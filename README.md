Hello Yall. My name is MacDaniel Maisel and looking for a new source of inspiration. I ended up choosing to make a bookstore! I love to read books in my freetime. Shoutout to Sandi Metz for creating Practical Object-Oriented Design. A great read that I enjoyed reading while studying programming among the many books i've read. Without further ado welcome to my bookstore and the many great things it will contain. A live version will appear as soon as I make it!
